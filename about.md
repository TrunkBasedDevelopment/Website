It is a branching model that promotes avoid shared development branches. We claim this makes for greater dev-team throughput, and less bugs, but requires discipline.

## Synopsis

* All developers working on a single shared trunk
* Branches made for releases, if needed at all
* "Branch by Abstraction" if need to make a change that'll take a while to complete
* "Feature Toggles" driving the above if needed

## Knock yourself out with

* Local branching - just don't share them
